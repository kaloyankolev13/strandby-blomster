            <button>What is the difference between bouquet size and price groups?</button>
            <p>There are 3 different price categories for most of our bouquets. Size varies with price, and includes more or fewer flowers. 
The image most often represents medium. The exact number of flowers may vary depending on the season and daily changes in prices at the florist, but we guarantee that the colour, shape and amount are always correct!</p>
